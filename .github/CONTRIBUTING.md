# Contributing to App

## Quick Reference

I want to …

- _report a bug!_ ➡️ [open an issue](#issues)
- _fix a bug!_ ➡️ [open a pull request](#pull-requests)
- _implement a new feature!_ ➡️ [open an issue to discuss it first, then a pull request](#feature)

## Issues

You can open an issue [here](https://github.com/averageeucplayer/rust-project-test/issues/new).
If you're reporting a bug, please include the output of the following commands:

- `cargo --version`
- Your OS name and version

## Pull Requests

You are welcome to open a pull request, but unless it is small and trivial, **please open an issue to discuss your idea first** 🙏🏼

Opening a pull request is as easy as forking the repository and committing your changes.
If you need any help with it or face any Git related problems, don't hesitate to ask for help

It may take time to review your pull request.
Please be patient
